** See code/mysim_NewClassLabels.txt for new class labes where:
Column one   : 1 = labels were corrigible, 0 = labels were correct , and NA = labels incorrigible 
Column two   : Contains file names
Column three : contains (potentially new) label for true class 1
Column four  : contains (potentially new) label for true class 2
Column five  : contains (potentially new) label for true class 3
and so forth

To read code/mysim_NewClassLabels.txt into R use:
newLabels <- read.table(code/mysim_NewClassLabels.txt)

*** Conditional correct assignment summaries are computed
 excluding data sets with incorrigible labels (see NA count)
 after the assignment matrix has been relabeled.
 Note that assignment values are still recorded in 
 ConditionalAssignment.txt for corrigible matrices which failed
 the minimum assignment criterion.
