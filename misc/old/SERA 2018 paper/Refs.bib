  abstract = {The classification maximum likelihood approach is sufficiently general
	to encompass many current clustering algorithms, including those
	based on the sum of squares criterion and on the criterion of Friedman
	and Rubin (1967, Journal of the American Statistical Association
	62, 1159-1178). However, as currently implemented, it does not allow
	the specification of which features (orientation, size, and shape)
	are to be common to all clusters and which may differ between clusters.
	Also, it is restricted to Gaussian distributions and it does not
	allow for noise. We propose ways of overcoming these limitations.
	A reparameterization of the covariance matrix allows us to specify
	that some, but not all, features be the same for all clusters. A
	practical framework for non-Gaussian clustering is outlined, and
	a means of incorporating noise in the form of a Poisson process is
	described. An approximate Bayesian method for choosing the number
	of clusters is given. The performance of the proposed methods is
	studied by simulation, with encouraging results. The methods are
	applied to the analysis of a data set arising in the study of diabetes,
	and the results seem better than those of previous analyses. A magnetic
	resonance image (MRI) of the brain is also analyzed, and the methods
	appear successful in extracting the main features of anatomical interest.
	The methods described here have been implemented in both Fortran
	and S-PLUS versions, and the software is freely available through
	StatLib.},
